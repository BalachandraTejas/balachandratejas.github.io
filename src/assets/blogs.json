The stack of business cards have eaten enough dust and found their way to the trash can. Boils down to two things. Firstly, what content would I be able to create. Secondly, would I be able to do this for long term(at least 2 to 3 years).",

Apart from being free, the entire content and design will be in one repo. Hoping it would be easy to manage."
